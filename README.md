# Companies-House-Data-Engineering-for-Financial-Analysts

## Summary
A financial aggregator has outlined an ambitious initiative to develop a robust data pipeline integrating comprehensive datasets from the UK Companies House and, in the future, SEC EDGAR APIs. The goal is to enable seamless ingestion, storage, and retrieval of critical business data while maintaining a flexible architecture for easy extensibility.

Key requirements include:
- Ingestion of data via bulk downloads, real-time APIs, and streaming mechanisms.
- Dual storage strategy leveraging Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for documents and a metadata system for rapid access.
- A secure and maintainable system with an emphasis on metadata tracking.
- Building a framework capable of extending and integrating U.S. datasets such as SEC EDGAR APIs.

## Scope
- **Requirement analysis**  
- **Data ingestion framework**  
- **Storage implementation**  
- **Testing and validation**  
- **Documentation and knowledge transfer**  
- **Future proofing**
